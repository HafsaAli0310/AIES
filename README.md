# AIES Assignment 02

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have:
Python installed (version 3.6 or above is recommended)
No external libraries are required — it only uses Python’s built-in tkinter and time modules.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup & Execution
### 🔹 Step 1: Open Your Code Editor
Open any code editor or IDE like VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, or even IDLE (comes with Python).

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a New Python File
Download the python file:
MinimaxAlphaPruning.py

### 🔹 Step 3: Run the File
You can run it in multiple ways:
✅ Using Terminal/Command Prompt:
python MinimaxAlphaPruning.py
✅ Using VS Code:
Right-click the file → Run Python File in Terminal
✅ Using IDLE:
Open the .py file → Press F5 to run

### 🔹 Step 4: Play the Game
Once you run it:
A GUI window will open with a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid
Click a cell to make your move (you play as X)
The AI will respond (as O) using Alpha-Beta Pruning
Meanwhile, the terminal will log both Minimax and Alpha-Beta moves and their computation time

### 🔹 Step 5: End of Game
When a player wins or it’s a draw, a pop-up will display the result.
Close and restart the window to play again.
